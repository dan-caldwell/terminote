[√] Search notes from CLI
[√] Ability to make shortcuts (and list shortcuts) to quickly reference without having the search preview cut off
    [√] Register ref when closing out file if it hasn't been registered already -> can do this via the differences between old and new refs from registerRefsFromNote
[√] Open note by ID (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
[√] --edit flag to open a file to edit a ref
[√] Save ref description in refList.json, and update description on closing a file, to prevent searching every single file every time
[√] Re-write flags as classes

[ ] CLI update (make it easier to update the app from the CLI) -> `note update`
[ ] Set up help (probably via yargs)
