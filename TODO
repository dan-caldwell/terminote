[ ] Work mode
[ ] Search notes from CLI
[ ] Open note by ID (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
[ ] Need to group search terms together if they're close together to prevent duplicate console.logs of matches
[ ] Cached search results? (maybe if file has not been modified)
[ ] CLI update (make it easier to update the app from the CLI) -> `note update`
[ ] Ability to make shortcuts (and list shortcuts) to quickly reference without having the search preview cut off
    [ ] Register ref when closing out file if it hasn't been registered already -> can do this via the differences between old and new refs from registerRefsFromNote
